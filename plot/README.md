This library implements high-level functions to generate plots and drawings.
Although we use Python/Plotly, the goal is to provide a convenient
V library that is different than Plotly. The difference happens
because we want convenience for the V developer while getting the
fantastic quality of Plotly grinning.

Internally, we use Plotly via a Python 3 script. First, we generate a
JSON files in a directory under `$VMODULES/vsl/plot`, and then
we call python3 using V's `os.execute`. The JSON file is then read
by Plotly and the plot is generated.

`vsl.plot` follows the structure of
[Plotly's graph_objects](https://plotly.com/python/graph-objects/).
Check the examples folder and compare it to Plotly's Python examples
for a better understanding.
